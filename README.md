Welcome to my personal portfolio of hands-on projects developed during the **AI Engineering Master's Program**. This repository showcases a variety of real-world use cases across:

- ‚úÖ Python & Object-Oriented Programming
- ‚úÖ Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- ‚úÖ Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing
- ‚úÖ Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning
- ‚úÖ MLOps & Explainable AI
