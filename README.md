# üß† AI Engineering Portfolio 

üöß Repository in Continuous Development üöß
This repository is a work in progress. I am currently working on the 11 required projects, which are under active development and continuously updated. Each project will be added as it is completed.

Welcome to my personal portfolio of hands-on projects developed during the **AI Engineering Master's Program**. This repository showcases a variety of real-world use cases across:

- ‚úÖ Python & Object-Oriented Programming
- ‚úÖ Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- ‚úÖ Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing
- ‚úÖ Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning
- ‚úÖ MLOps & Explainable AI
