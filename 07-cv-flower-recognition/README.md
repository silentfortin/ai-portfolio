# GreenAI â€“ Flower Recognition Optimization

> Developed as part of **AI Portfolio â€“ Project 07**  
> This project develops and fine-tunes **deep learning models** to classify **flower images** (Daisy & Dandelion) for smart AgriTech automation, supporting real-world innovation in the agriculture sector.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

GreenAI addresses the challenge of **automatically classifying flower species** to enhance data-driven agricultural processes for GreenTech Solutions Ltd.  
The system uses **Transfer Learning** (EfficientNet-B0, timm) and advanced optimization strategies to maximize **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **efficiency**.

The project experimented with:  
- **Baseline feature extraction** (frozen EfficientNet-B0 backbone)  
- **Full fine-tuning** (after 5 epochs, unfreeze backbone & retrain)  
- **Rich data augmentation** (Albumentations)  
- **Learning rate scheduling & regularization**  

This repository includes the **final best-performing model** and all files needed for reproducibility.

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Setup & Results

Two main experimental setups were performed:

| Run | Model Setup             | Training Strategy                  | Optimizer & LR         | Goal               |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| A   | Baseline EfficientNet-B0| Frozen backbone (feature extractor)| AdamW (lr=1e-3) + Cosine| Establish baseline |
| B   | Fine-tuned EfficientNet | All layers trainable after 5 epochs| AdamW (lr=1e-4) + Cosine| Maximize F1-score |
