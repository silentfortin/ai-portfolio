# GourmetAI â€“ Food Image Classification Optimization

> Developed as part of **AI Engineering Master â€“ Week 6**  
> This project develops and fine-tunes **deep learning models** to classify **food images** into 14 categories, supporting innovation in the food-tech sector.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

GourmetAI tackles the challenge of **accurately classifying food images** to enhance **user experience** and **business processes** in the food industry.  
The system leverages **Transfer Learning with ResNet50** and advanced optimization strategies to improve **accuracy**, **generalization**, and **efficiency**.  

The project experimented with:  
- **Baseline feature extraction** (frozen ResNet backbone)  
- **Gradual unfreezing fine-tuning** (classifier â†’ layer4 â†’ layer3)  
- **Regularization & learning rate scheduling**  

This repository includes the **best-performing fine-tuned model** and all files needed for reproducibility.

Two main experimental setups were performed:

| Run | Model Setup             | Training Strategy                   | Optimizer & LR          | Goal               |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| A   | Baseline ResNet50       | Frozen backbone, classifier only     | AdamW (lr=1e-3)         | Establish baseline |
| B   | Fine-tuned ResNet50     | Gradual unfreezing: fc â†’ layer4 â†’ layer3 | AdamW + CosineAnnealing | Improve performance|
